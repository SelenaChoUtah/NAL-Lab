In this series of folders is a collection of aptly named MATLAB code to 
support the processing and visualization of the data associated with the 
turning study.

This includes a function (titled "importfileOpenCap.m") that is required 
to open the individual OpenCap folders. 

In order to process the data from individuals subjects, the code scripts
are organized in order of the data they process.
 -The file "Float_OpenCap.m" processes, visualizes, and summarizes the data
  collected using the OpenCap motion capture system. The data files are trc
  marker files. 
 -The file "LoadSol_Process.m" processes and visualizes the data collected 
  from the loadsol pressure sensors. The data files are text files.
 -The file "RSME_Process.m" processes and summarizes the data collected
  from completing the RSME survey after each trial. The data files are 
  excel sheets.
